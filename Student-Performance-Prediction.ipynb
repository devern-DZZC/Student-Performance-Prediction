    "# Student Performance Prediction Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses various Python-based libraries to create different machine learning models to predict the grade of a student based on a number of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The data that the model will be learning from and making predictions on was created by Rabie El Kharoua, and the dataset can be found on Kaggle.  \n",
    "[Link to the dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset?resource=download)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "This dataset contains comprehensive information on 2,392 high school students, detailing their demographics, study habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic performance. The target variable, `GradeClass`, classifies students' grades into distinct categories, providing a robust dataset for educational research, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis.  \n",
